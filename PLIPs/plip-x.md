<!--
You can leave these HTML comments in your merged PLIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides.
HTML comments will not appear in your PLIP and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again.
-->

<!--
This is the suggested template for new EIs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your PLIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `plip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. Your title should be 44 characters or less.
-->

## Simple Summary
<!--
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the PLIP.
-->

## Abstract
<!--
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
-->

## Motivation
<!--
The motivation is critical for PLIPs. Your motivation should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PLIP solves. PLIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
-->

## Specification
<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. 
-->

## Rationale
<!--
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--
All PLIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The PLIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. PLIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.
-->

## Test Cases
<!--
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for PLIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other PLIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.
-->

## Implementation
<!--
The implementations must be completed before any PLIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the PLIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
